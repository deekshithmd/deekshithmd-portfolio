      <p>
        I have completed my B.E in Computer Science and Engineering from NMAM
        Institute of Technology, Nitte. Later I joined Wipro as Project Engineer
        and worked for one year. While working there I decided to continue my
        career in web development so started learning by building mini projects
        and later joined FullStack(MERN) web development bootcamp called
        neogCamp. Later I joined web3 startup called Push Protocol and frontend
        developer.
